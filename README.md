## DBPedia

DBPedia is a crowd-sourced effort that aims to extract structured data from a variety of different Wikimedia projects. The data is structured as an open knowledge graph (OKG), so it's available to everyone on the web. Since DBPedia is served as linked data, it can be interacted with in a variety of different ways:

* standard web browsers
* automated crawlers
* **complex queries with SQL-like query languages (e.g. SPARQL)**
